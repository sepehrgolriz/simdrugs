### Data availability
Due to the restriction on the access to the TCGA data, we are not at the liberty to share the data. If an individual
wishes to replicate the results, they could apply for access the TCGA data at their access portal
(https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga). Alternatively, you can download
the ssGSEA scores at this link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1faP7-IzfzFDv4sJjnl00AKRmqw2l0UMB?usp=sharing
Simply paste the downloaded files in the data folder and run the notebooks/scripts.
